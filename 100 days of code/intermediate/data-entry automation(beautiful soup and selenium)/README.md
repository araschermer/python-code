In this project, I used Selenium and Beautiful Soup to implement an automated tool to get all apartments listings form 
a given website and get all imporant information related to the listings and eventually using the obtained information to fill out a google form.

I used Beautiful Soup to get:
- Addresses of the properties    
-  Prices of the properties
- Links to the ads on the website

I also used Selenium to fill out a Google Form with all the information that was obtained from the previous step
For this project.

I used some private environment variables that can be easily replaced.
