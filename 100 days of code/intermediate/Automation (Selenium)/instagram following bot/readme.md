## In this project, I use Selenium to implement an Instagram following bot, to follow all the followers that are  following a certain account 
- #### In login method, the bot logs into Instagram and accepts the cookies.
- #### Then the bot redirects to a certain page to follow its followers, open the followers list.
- #### The bot eventually follows the followers of that page and ignores the ones that are already being followed from that account that the bot operates.
