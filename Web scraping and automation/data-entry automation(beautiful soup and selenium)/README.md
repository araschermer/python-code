<br /> In this project, I use <a >Selenium</a> and <a>Beautiful Soup</a>  to implement an automate a tool that gets all apartments listings form 
 the <a href="https://www.zillow.com">Zillow</a> website and all important information related to the listings and eventually use the obtained information to fill out a Google form.

I used Beautiful Soup to get:
- Addresses of the properties    
-  Prices of the properties
- Links to the ads on the website
I also used Selenium to fill out a Google Form with all the information that was obtained from the previous step
